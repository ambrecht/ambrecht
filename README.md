# Tino Ambrecht

>The man who orders together many occurrences into a
plan, into a visionâ€”he is . . . the true historical artist, the
painter of a great painting of the most excellent composition; he is . . . the true creator of a history.

â€”Johann Gottfried Von Herder

# About Me

My name is Tino Ambrecht, in a world dominated mainly by specialists, it took me some time to realize that I am a generalist and that this is also my greatest strength. As a generalist, I don't burn for a specific topic, I'm interested in the big picture, in the totality. At times, I work very intensively on a specific subject until I have understood the basic principles. Then I combine this knowledge with the findings from other areas and thus piece by piece get a picture of the big and whole.

Vitruvuis provides in his writing, "Architectura" and with his description of the ideal of an architect, the best definition for a generalist:

    Skill in manual work as well as in theory.
    Inclination and desire for constant learning
    Skill in the use of tools
    An understanding of optics - how light penetrates
    History, so that signs can be highlighted and not misinterpreted Of cultural significance
    A strong understanding of philosophy so as to be able to engage in
    abstract thinking as well as honesty and courtesy Physics, to help make things stable
    Art, music, drama, drawing, painting and poetry to make things and suitable for their human purposes.

#### Vitruvuis thus provides a lesson that has lost none of its relevance in today's technology industry. The production of software requires a holistic approach, and it needs broad-based generalists who can maintain an overview in a constantly changing environment, always guided by timeless principles.
